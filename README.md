## Introduction

**Developer Protection & Freedom License** (DPFL) is an innovative open-source licensing agreement designed to empower developers with control over their creations while encouraging community collaboration. DPFL (hereafter referred to simply as DPFL unless otherwise specified) addresses key issues faced by developers in the licensing process and prevents unauthorized commercial use without sacrificing the freedom to share, modify, and redistribute.

The usage scenarios for DPFL cover the needs of individual developers, small teams, and businesses, particularly suitable for the following situations:

- Need to prevent commercial misuse without affecting non-commercial sharing;
- Desire to retain future control over the project’s licensing;
- Aim to promote community collaboration and non-commercial use of open-source projects;
- Protecting privacy and patent usage, preventing patent infringement.

The flexibility and control offered by DPFL make it an ideal choice for developers who wish to protect their rights while supporting open-source collaboration.

## Key Benefits of DPFL

1. **Protection of Developer Rights**  
   - DPFL ensures that **copyright remains with the developer**, allowing them to retain ownership and control over the future development of the project.
   - Developers have the right to change the licensing agreement for future versions or to make it proprietary, ensuring flexibility in project development.

2. **Clear Boundaries for Commercial Use**  
   - DPFL **defaults to non-commercial use**, meaning anyone can freely use, copy, and modify the software for non-commercial purposes.
   - Commercial use is permitted only with **written permission from the developer**, providing developers with additional revenue opportunities and preventing unauthorized commercialization of their work.

3. **Flexible Code Reuse Conditions**  
   - DPFL **encourages code reuse** while ensuring respect for the developer's original creation. Projects that reuse portions of DPFL-licensed code must retain attribution and adhere to the original DPFL licensing terms.
   - Files not containing DPFL code are free to choose their licensing, allowing **greater flexibility** in mixed projects.

4. **Enhanced Attribution and Promotion Control**  
   - When redistributing or promoting software licensed under DPFL, users must **retain the original attribution information**. Any promotion involving the developer’s name or brand must obtain written permission, protecting the developer’s reputation and ensuring transparency.

5. **Strong Privacy and Patent Protection**  
   - Features involving privacy must obtain **explicit user consent** before use, reinforcing ethical standards in software development.
   - The agreement includes **patent retaliation clauses** to prevent abuse related to patents, providing developers with additional legal protection.

6. **Multilingual Accessibility**  
   - DPFL provides multilingual versions, supporting users worldwide, with **consistency across languages** to ensure ease of understanding and application.

## Overview of the License

DPFL is suitable for developers who wish to achieve open-source collaboration while maintaining control over commercial use of their projects. The main terms of the agreement include:

- **Usage Rights**: Non-commercial use, modification, and redistribution are freely permitted. Commercial use requires permission.
- **Code Reuse**: Projects reusing DPFL code must retain the original license, while files not containing DPFL code can choose their licensing terms.
- **Flexibility of Agreement**: Developers may change the licensing terms for future versions.
- **Jurisdiction**: The laws of the developer's country or region apply.
- **Privacy Protection**: Use of features involving privacy must obtain user consent.
- **Patent Protection**: Includes patent retaliation clauses.
- **Multilingual Support**: Provides multilingual versions to ensure applicability worldwide.

## Examples of Suitable Scenarios for DPFL

The scenarios for using the Developer Protection & Freedom License (DPFL) primarily focus on developers wishing to maintain control over their projects while encouraging non-commercial collaboration in open source. Here are some specific situations demonstrating how DPFL applies to individuals and businesses:

### 1. Individual Developers Wanting to Protect Original Content and Reputation  
**Scenario**: An individual developer releases a niche tool to help data analysts quickly organize data, deciding to open-source it for broader use.  
**Need**: The developer wants their work to be widely used but is concerned about commercial companies using it for profit without permission.  
**Using DPFL**: The developer can choose the DPFL license, allowing the tool to be freely used for non-commercial projects while requiring permission for commercial use. This way, the developer retains control while benefiting non-commercial users.

### 2. Open Source Project Authors Wanting to Avoid "Free-Riding" Commercial Use  
**Scenario**: A team develops an efficient file transfer tool and wants to open-source it to attract contributors for improvements. However, they find some commercial companies might embed it in paid services, profiting without giving back to the project.  
**Need**: The team wants to limit commercial use while encouraging collaboration from non-commercial projects to enhance quality.  
**Using DPFL**: By using DPFL, the team can ensure that commercial companies need to obtain permission to use the file transfer tool, while non-commercial developers can use it freely. This protects the project's free sharing nature while preventing unauthorized commercialization.

### 3. Development Team Providing Internal Solutions for Enterprises  
**Scenario**: A startup company develops an employee management system for internal use and wants to share it as an open-source project for other businesses to learn from.  
**Need**: The company wants other companies to reference and use the system but wishes to prevent competitors from utilizing it for commercial sales.  
**Using DPFL**: The startup can open-source the system under DPFL, allowing other businesses to learn, research, and use it non-commercially while requiring written permission for any commercial use. This enables the startup to control its commercial distribution.

### 4. Developer Community Protecting Innovations in Open Source Projects  
**Scenario**: A developer community collaboratively develops an algorithm library, incorporating many innovative algorithms. They wish to promote research and learning but do not want their algorithms easily used by companies for profit.  
**Need**: Ensure the algorithm library fosters open-source collaboration while preventing commercial companies from using the technology without permission.  
**Using DPFL**: The community opts for DPFL licensing, allowing researchers and students to use the algorithm library freely while requiring commercial companies to obtain permission. This encourages non-commercial development while avoiding unauthorized commercialization.

### 5. Software Developers Wanting to Maintain Future Control Over Project Direction  
**Scenario**: A developer creates open-source music synthesis software, planning to maintain and update it long-term. They worry that if needs change in the future, restrictive agreements may lead to loss of control over the project.  
**Need**: While open-sourcing the project, they wish to retain flexible control over future versions, allowing for adjustments to the agreement or even proprietary status.  
**Using DPFL**: The “Agreement Change Clause” in DPFL allows developers to adjust the licensing for future versions at any time, including switching to proprietary. By choosing DPFL, developers ensure current openness while retaining future direction flexibility.

### 6. Enterprises Wanting to Encourage Community Contributions While Retaining Some Control  
**Scenario**: A tech company releases a front-end framework, aiming to attract community developers to contribute plugins and extensions. The company wants the framework improved by the community while avoiding direct use by competitors for commercial projects.  
**Need**: Encourage community participation while ensuring the company's competitive advantage remains intact.  
**Using DPFL**: The company can open the framework under DPFL, allowing developers to freely create plugins and improvements while requiring competitors to obtain permission for any commercial use, thus preserving the company's commercial advantage.
